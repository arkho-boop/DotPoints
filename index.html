		<b>HAPPY SUNDAY</b> -- This week saw fissures in the Liberal-National Coalition over a proposed target of net zero emissions by 2050. The Liberals (particularly the PM) want Australia to adopt the target, the Nats have a few influential holdouts who see the target as a threat to the bush. Watch this space -- most people think that we will adopt a net-zero by 2050 target, but we're yet to find out the size and scope of the <b>carve-out for the bush</b> the Nats will negotiate.

		Elsewhere: <b>The Government voted against an investigation</b> that would have determined whether former cabinet minister <b>Christian Porter</b> had to disclose the source of the <b>secret trust</b> that paid for his legal fight with the ABC for its allegations against him of historical rape. The trust is reportedly valued between <b>$600K and $1M</b>.

		Australia is set to deliver <b>booster shots</b> of the Covid-19 vaccines from as early as <b>next week</b>. <b>LOOKING AT:</b> Will ATAGI endorse <b>mixing vaccines</b>? A few countries have started doing this, with the US' FDA approving mixing Pfizer, J&J, and Moderna last week.
